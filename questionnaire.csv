Being guided by vibrations on my arm made navigating blindfolded (way) easier than I expected. The duration of the vibration hinted the distance I had to move well and I never felt lost in the shelf/positioning of my arm during the experient. 
The bracelet itself was light and comfortable enough to (incase) carry it around in every-day life. As mentioned in a quick chat after the experiment, it was - at some points - at the first second not completely clear after moving left/right whether I had to move up or I had to grasp the object. It may be considered to change the vibration into a) all sensors are vibrating or b) the last direction starts vibrating when the final position is reached.
Generally spoken, am I impressed by the idea of this tactile bracelet :)","During the grasping task, I could really feel the difference between feeling the vibration as an indication or being told in which direction I should move. Eventhough I normally don´t have a problem determining right and left, it was at the first second harder to decide the direction. This may be connected with guessing the direction I had to move next, though.
All in all, had I the feeling that it sometimes took me a millisecond more to understand where to move in comparison to the task with the tactile bracelet.","Not more than: I´m super invested to see where this could turn into in the future and I want to thank you that you innovate something like this that could change blind people´s life in general!

I only asked for the left one to be moved when it might have been smarter to also move the top and bottom one a little further to the right. ","In the beginning, it became clear pretty fast that once a movement up or down was required, the only thing left to do was grasping the object, so at first I started anticipating the grasping. Once I was told not to do so, it was easy to relax and wait for the instructions.
It was interesting to get a feeling of the spatial arrangement of the shelf and the fruits and being told beforehand to try to be as fast as possible was fun because it gave me the feeling of a challenge and made me want to actually perform well. ","",""

With the tactile bracelet and the vibrations its easier not to get confused in that sense and I feel more confident while following those instructions. ","It was ok, but maybe it would be necessary to give the instructions a bit slower, because at the begining was hard to completely understand what I needed to do, because I though I had understood the instructions, but when we did the trial I realized that I didn't  really understand what I needed to do and made lots of mistakes until I really got the task.

I felt the vibration rather inside my arm than on my skin. The left/right cues were easier to distinguish than the up/down cues, since the motors were each placed upon one of my two underarm bones. Also the up cue was ""clearer"" than the down cue, probably because the up one was placed right upon the tendon reaching to my middle- and ring finger. The down cue stimulated several muscles/rather ""soft"" parts of my arm which spread the vibration and made it feel a bit ""fuzzy"" compared to the others. Maybe a bit less intense vibration and smaller motors would make it easier to locate the position on the skin as well.","When I was instructed to the set up (blind already) and shown the three shelves, I actively thought about how to relate their position to my body so I could find them again without help (upper shelf  - my forehead; middle shelf - chest; lower shelf - knee). For the left/right dimension, it helped that I sat next to the (covered) shelf before and knew its width in relation to my body. So initially I got a spatial orientation by some active thinking, but of course after a few tasks that got more and more intuitive. I relaxed and felt acting robot-like. I also had some visual imagination of the fruits and knew their position after some tasks, but I didn't have a visual imagination of the whole shelf, only of the single fruits that I grasped at that moment.","",""

 - The detection of vibration varies depending on the body tissue. In soft parts, vibration is better recognized than in hard parts (for example, on the bone).","I think:

 - reference point is very important in this case because we can easily lose the objects’ location by losing the reference point. 

 - as there is no clear sign for front and back, participants must intuitively adjust the front and back distance.

 - trust in the system is achieved over time. Any failure can cause users to refer to their own senses rather than rely on the system, or simply ignore it. So, we should use infallible systems (such as Poka-yoke) to have a safe and reliable system.
","The design of a reliable system is very important because, with the decrease in trust in the system, the stress of users increases when using it. The increase in stress that is associated with the tightening of the muscles reduces the correct detection of the intensity, duration, and direction of the vibration, which ultimately increases the error in using the system.
